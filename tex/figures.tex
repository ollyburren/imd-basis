  \caption{Schematic of basis creation and projection. Basis creation: GWAS summary statistics for related traits are combined to create a matrix, M (n x m), of harmonised effect sizes ($\hat\beta$) and a learned vector of shrinkage values for each SNP. After multiplying each row of M by the shrinkage vector, PCA is used to decompose M into  component and loading matrices. Basis projection: External trait effects are harmonised with respect to the basis, shrinkage applied and the resultant vector is multiplied by the basis loading matrix to obtain component scores which can then be used for further analyses.}

  \caption{Hierarchical clustering of basis diseases and their UKBB counterparts in \textbf{a} unweighted basis constructed using $\hat\beta$  \textbf{b}  basis constructed using continuous shrinkage applied to $\hat\beta$.  Heatmaps indicate projected $\hat\delta$ for each disease on each component PC1-PC13, with grey indicating 0 (no difference from control), and darker shades of blue or magenta showing departure from controls in one direction or the other. GWAS datasets: T1D = type 1 diabetes, CEL= celiac disease, asthma, MS =multiple sclerosis, UC =ulcerative colitis, CD = Crohn's disease, RA =rheumatoid arthritis, VIT =vitiligo, SLE =systemic lupus erythematosus, PSC=primary sclerosing cholangitis, PBC=primary biliary cholangitis, LADA=latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, IgA\_NEPH= IgA nephropathy. UKBB\_ prefixed diseases correspond to self reported disease status in UK Biobank.}

  \caption{Hierarchical clustering of projected diseases significantly different from control (FDR < 1\%) or of small sample size. Coloured labels are used to distinguish UKBB (grey) and other GWAS (green) datasets. Heatmaps indicate delta values for each disease on each component PC1-PC13, with grey indicating 0 (no difference from control), and darker shades of blue or magenta showing departure from controls in one direction or the other. An overlaid * indicates delta was significantly non zero (FDR<0.01). Roman numerals indicate clusters described in the text. Abbreviations: ANCA- = anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody negative, Ank. Spond = ankylosing spondylitis, EGPA = eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, EO = extended oligo, ERA = juvenile enthesitis-related arthritis, IgGPos = IgG positive, JIA = juvenile idiopathic arthritis, MPO+ = myeloperoxidase positive NMO = neuromyelitis optica, PO = persistent oligo, PR3+ = proteinase 3 positive, PsA = psoriatic arthritis, RF +/- = polyoligo rheumatoid factor positive/negative, SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus, UC = ulcerative colitis.}

  \caption{Forest plots showing projected values for diseases significant overall and on components 1. Grey squares dots indicate projected data and 95\% confidence intervals. Red dots indicate the 13 IMD used for basis construction and for which no confidence interval is available. Points to the right of each line indicate disease classification according to whether  they have specific autoantibodies that are either directly implicated in disease pathogenesis ("pathogenic") or which are specific to the disease, but not involved in pathogenesis ("non-pathogenic"). Diseases that are not associated with specific autoantibodies were classified as "none". Abbreviations: ANCA- = anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody negative, Ank. Spond = ankylosing spondylitis, EGPA = eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, EO = extended oligo, ERA = juvenile enthesitis-related arthritis, IgGPos = IgG positive, JIA = juvenile idiopathic arthritis, LADA = latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, NMO = neuromyelitis optica, PO = persistent oligo, PsA = psoriatic arthritis, RF +/- = polyoligo rheumatoid factor positive/negative, SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus, UC = ulcerative colitis.}
