  \caption{Hierarchical clustering of basis diseases and their UKBB counterparts in \textbf{a} hard-thresholded, LD-thinned basis constructed using Z scores \textbf{b} hard-thresholded, LD-thinned basis constructed using $\hat\beta$ .  Heatmaps indicate projected $\hat\delta$ for each disease on each component PC1-PC13, with grey indicating 0 (no difference from control), and darker shades of blue or magenta showing departure from controls in one direction or the other. GWAS datasets: T1D = type 1 diabetes, CEL= celiac disease, asthma, MS =multiple sclerosis, UC =ulcerative colitis, CD = Crohn's disease, RA =rheumatoid arthritis, VIT =vitiligo, SLE =systemic lupus erythematosus, PSC=primary sclerosing cholangitis, PBC=primary biliary cholangitis, LADA=latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, IgA\_NEPH= IgA nephropathy. UKBB\_ prefixed diseases correspond to self reported disease status in UK Biobank.}

   \caption{Comparison of projects of the same traits from datasets with different ancestries.
     (a) in psoriatic arthritis, projections from a Spanish and UK (European ancestry) data set are shown with their 95\% confidence intervals for each PC. Projections are very similar, with a constant of proportionality (black line) close to 1 (blue dashed line). The null hypothesis of proportionality is not rejected (p=0.08). (b) in ankylosing spondylitis, there is a more pronounced difference with an attenuation of the projections towards 0 in a Turkish/Iranian ancestry dataset compared to European ancestry, though the two remain proportional (p=0.74).
     In UKBB, Neale analysed only a white European subset while GeneAtlas includes additional non-European cases.  Over 78 traits found in both datasets with similar case counts (within 10\%), the additional sample size in GeneAtlas results in (c) generally more significant projections while (d) 
the constant of proportionality (GeneAtlas/Neale) is centred on 0.9.}

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{suppfig-consistency.pdf}
  \caption{For each group of traits, we compared the significance of Spearman correlation test of basis component SNP weights with trait $\beta$ (evidence for consistency, see Supplementary Note) with component FDR. We found traits with increasing component significance (smaller FDR) tended to also show more significant Spearman correlations, although the pattern was much weaker for blood cell counts despite more observations with small component FDRs.  We subsequently filtered blood cell counts to count as significant only the outlying trait which was clearly significant by both component FDR and Spearman correlation, corresponding to eosinophil counts on PC13. Datasets are grouped by: blood cell counts,$^{21}$ cytokines,$^{23}$ flow cytometric immune cell counts,$^{22}$ GWAS datasets except UKBB, UKBB (Neale).}
